### Description
A clone of the Club Penguin game "Thin Ice", with the addition of a self-playing mode where the computer calculates the correct solution.

The course consists of ice blocks that the player walks on. The player should from point A to point B and cannot walk on a block they have already walked on. All blocks must not be walked on but the more blocks the more points. Courses are randomly generated.

### Language
Java

### Framework
Swing

### MVP (minimum viable product)
* One level
* Level is represented by squares of different color
* Player should be able to move between squares and complete the level
* Squares that have been walked on cannot be walked on again
* Squares that the player has walked on should change color to blue

### Code and commit message formatting
* Imperative form
* Refer to issues fixed at the end of each commit message

For example: `Add player sprite. Fix #21`
