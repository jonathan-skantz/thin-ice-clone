# DD1349 INDA project

A clone of the Club Penguin game "Thin Ice", with the addition of a self-playing mode where the computer calculates the solution.

The course consists of ice blocks that the player walks on. The player should from point A to point B and cannot walk on a block they have already walked on. All blocks must not be walked on but the more blocks the more points. Courses are randomly generated.
